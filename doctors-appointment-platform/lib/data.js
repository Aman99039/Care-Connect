          <p>
            Nutrition is the foundation of good health. The food we eat directly
            impacts our energy levels, growth, immunity, and even mental
            well-being. A poor diet is linked to chronic diseases such as
            diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and even certain cancers. On the
            other hand, a balanced diet can improve our productivity, help us
            stay active, and enhance our quality of life. Nutrition is not just
            about calories—it’s about providing the body with the right mix of
            macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and
            micronutrients (vitamins and minerals).

            Pregnancy is a delicate stage where a woman needs proper nutrition,
            medical care, and emotional support. Regular antenatal check-ups
            detect complications early. Supplements like iron and folic acid
            prevent anemia and birth defects. Vaccinations protect both mother
            and child.

          <p>
            Nutrition is not about strict diets or expensive superfoods—it’s
            about making sustainable, everyday choices that keep our body and
            mind strong. By adopting small but consistent changes, such as
            eating more vegetables, drinking enough water, and reducing junk
            food, we can create healthier lives and stronger communities.

            Access to trained health workers during delivery is critical. After
            birth, mothers need rest, nutrition, and monitoring to prevent
            infections. Breastfeeding should start within the first hour of

            When mothers are cared for and children are given the best start in
            life, communities become stronger, healthier, and more resilient.
            Investing in maternal and child health is one of the best
            investments a society can make for its future.
